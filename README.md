## your own journaling diary :)
## I know that a lot of stuff doesn't work, but works is:
- font bold
- font italic
- font underline
- heading size from 1 to 6
- image adding
- saving in .md format
- theme changing
- and that's it :)

Yeah, if you are seeing this, this was not good enough to be a status.

Thanks! :D
